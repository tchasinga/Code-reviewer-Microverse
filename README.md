<!-- FAQ (optional) -->

## ❓ FAQ (OPTIONAL) <a name="faq"></a>

> Here's two question that developer can ask 

- **What dependencies does the project have, and how do I install them?**

   - Answer one : 
>For HTML and CSS projects, there are no specific dependencies required for the markup and styling languages themselves. However, you may choose to use external libraries or frameworks to simplify the development process and add additional functionality.

For example, you may use a front-end framework like Bootstrap or Foundation to streamline the layout and styling of your HTML pages. You may also use a JavaScript library like jQuery to add interactive functionality to your pages.

To install these dependencies, you can typically download the necessary files from the library's website or use a package manager like npm. For example, to install Bootstrap using npm, you can run the command npm install bootstrap.

It's important to note that while using external libraries and frameworks can speed up development, they may also increase the complexity of your project and make it harder to maintain. It's important to choose dependencies carefully and only use what you really need to achieve your project goals.


[Is-there-any-documentation-or-examples-available-to-help-meget-started-with-using-the-project?]**

  - Answer Two
   > Yes, most open-source projects typically provide documentation and examples to help new developers get started with using the project. This documentation may include information on how to install and configure the project, as well as tutorials and code samples demonstrating how to use its various features and capabilities.

In addition to the official documentation, many open-source projects also have active communities of developers who can provide support and guidance to new users. These communities may offer forums, chat rooms, or other channels where developers can ask questions, share ideas, and get help with any issues they encounter while using the project.

If you are interested in using an open-source project, it's a good idea to start by exploring the available documentation and reaching out to the project's community for support and guidance. This can help you get up and running quickly and ensure that you are using the project effectively and efficiently.
